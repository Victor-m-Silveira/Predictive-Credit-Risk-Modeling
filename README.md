# Credit Risk Analysis with Python

## Overview 📈

This project is centered around the analysis of credit risk using data-driven techniques within a Python computational environment. Through the application of statistical analysis and machine learning models, we aim to provide a granular insight into the likelihood of credit default, aiding in the decision-making process for lending institutions.

## Dataset 🗃️

The analysis is based on two datasets: 
- `credit_risk.csv`: The original dataset containing raw credit data including demographics, credit history, and loan details.
- `credit_risk_cleaned.csv`: The preprocessed version of the dataset after meticulous cleaning, which is used for model training and analysis.

## Features and Cleaning Process 🧹

The cleaning process involved:
- Handling missing values and outliers
- Encoding categorical variables for model readiness
- Normalizing and scaling numerical features to ensure model efficacy

## Analytical Approach 🧠

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- We performed an in-depth EDA to uncover patterns, anomalies, and correlations within the dataset using advanced visualization techniques.

### Predictive Modeling 🤖
- Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest classifiers, were evaluated to predict the probability of default.

### Model Evaluation and Selection 📊
- Models were rigorously tested using cross-validation, and their performance was measured using metrics such as AUC-ROC, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

### Bootstrapping and Statistical Inference 📉
- Bootstrapping techniques were applied to estimate the confidence intervals for key statistical figures, thus ensuring the robustness of our predictions.
